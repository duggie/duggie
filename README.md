# Hi, it's me, I'm Duggie

**Director of Engineering | Principal Architect**

Hands-on technology leader building regulated cloud, data, and AI platforms.

## 🔹 Profile

I lead and scale engineering organisations while remaining technically engaged in architecture, platform design, and delivery at enterprise scale. My focus is on cloud-native systems, distributed platforms, and production-ready data and AI workloads — particularly within regulated environments.

My production work lives in private repositories, owned by my employer or clients. This space reflects reference material, architectural examples, and insights that align with leadership-level technical thinking. You won't find daily feature commits. I am a low-volume contributor.
