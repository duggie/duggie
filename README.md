# 👋 Hi, I'm Duggie  
**Engineering Leader • Senior Technical Architect (AWS) • Python Practitioner • Serverless Evangelist**

I'm a hands-on senior architect with 25 years’ experience designing, building and stabilising systems across insurance, healthcare and finance industries (EXL). Wealth of experience in large ecommerce platforms and distribution (BlackStar). I know how to give things away (for gathering reviews - Bazaarvoice). I made your internet look better with webfonts (Monotype).

I’m known for being a “lynch-pin” - I get things done. To engineering teams, I bring calm, senior presence. That means stability, clarity and a strong sense of direction.

I architect systems end-to-end, with test-first, secure-by-design, cost-aware and quality as my key guiding principles. I lead by example. I can get involved with some hands-on contributions when my teams need me there.

## 🧠 What I Do
- **Serverless-first architecture** on AWS (Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, S3, SQS, SNS)
- **Python engineering** with TDD, clean interfaces and strong typing. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/) features a lot
- **Event-driven design**, replayable workflows, predictable systems
- **Stabilising struggling projects** and making teams more dependable
- **Security engineering** with least privilege, IAM discipline, TLSv1.3 (1.2 minimum) and mTLS, CMKs over service keys, secrets management
- **CI/CD pipelines** with Jenkins and GitHub Actions (or literally anything over doing it manually)
- **DevEx & team leadership**, creating safe, supportive, high-performance cultures

## 🛠️ Tools I Rely On
**Python & Quality:**  
- Ruff, Black, Pytest, Mocks, Dependency Injection, Synthetic Data Generators  
- Structured logging, type hints everywhere, ADRs, clean boundaries
- using AI to assist my workflows

**AWS:**  
- Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, S3, Dynamo/RDS, API Gateway  
- SSM Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, X-Ray  
- Terraform/Terragrunt for infra as code (SAM for personal projects)

**Containers & Local Dev:**  
- Docker, multi-stage builds, minimal images, consistent team-wide execution  
- Docker Compose / Makefiles for orchestration  
- Local-only dev for speed, trust boundaries and cost control

**Security & Scanning:**  
- Trivy, Terrascan, SonarQube, Gitleaks  
- IAM least privilege, encryption everywhere, VPC boundaries

---

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy
- **TDD from the start**  
- Unit tests + integration tests proving component interactions  
- Mock AWS calls locally (Moto), deploy to isolated dev accounts for full pipeline validation  
- Minimum **80% coverage**, automated quality gates  
- Contract testing where appropriate

---

## 🧱 How I Architect
- Draw diagrams *before* writing code — cheaper, clearer, collaborative. Easier to change than code
- Favour simple, event-driven serverless systems  
- Code to **interfaces** so services can be swapped with minimal friction  
- Multi-stage DB migrations with reversible paths and short-lived audit tables  
- Prefer 10 safe deployments over 1 risky “big bang”

---

## 👥 How I Lead
- Pair programming, constructive reviews, continuous coaching  
- Raise engineering standards by mentoring - and celebrating lessons learned  
- Define & promote best practices; enforce Definition of Ready & Done  
- Create safe spaces for mistakes and learning  
- Protect the team from distraction so they can focus on doing their best work  
- I believe in coaching people to become leaders — including making myself redundant
- All of your work is documented in a ticket on the board. If it's not on the board then you don't have to do it!

## 🚀 What Motivates Me
I love building systems that help people. If a piece of technology makes a customer’s application smoother, or reduces toil for a colleague, that’s the work I care about. I also want AI and ML to be used *for good* — accelerating medical research, helping diagnoses, reducing costs while improving outcomes.

"Don't be afraid to make mistakes."

"Duggie is the glue which holds teams together."

"Duggie is Mr Bazaarvoice, he lives and breathes what we do."

"Duggie is Mr EXL, the Ireland Engineering team *IS* him."

"You never know less about a project or subject than you do at the start. Make decisions which will result in less refactoring in the future."

"I write tests because I like to sleep well at night."

"Don't be a dick!"

"Under-promise and over-deliver."

"Always do better."
